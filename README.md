# Voting dApp
```
Create a voting dApp to cast votes, delegate and query results on chain
Request voting tokens to be minted using the API
(bonus) Store a list of recent votes in the backend and display that on frontend
(bonus) Use an oracle to fetch off-chain data
Use an oracle to fetch information from a data source of your preference
Use the data fetched to create the proposals in the constructor of the ballot
```
### Voting dApp integration guidelines
```
Build the frontend using Scaffold ETH 2 as a base
Build the backend using NestJS to provide the Mint method
Implement a single POST method
Request voting tokens from API
Use these tokens to interact with the tokenized ballot
All other interactions must be made directly on-chain
```
### Getting Started
Running the backend api's:
```shell 
cd backend
npm install
npm run start:dev
```
Running the frontend scaffold eth 2:
```shell 
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```
